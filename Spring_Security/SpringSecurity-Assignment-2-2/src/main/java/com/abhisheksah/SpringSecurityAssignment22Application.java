 Any application, which takes Security seriously, should NEVER store passwords in 
 plain text format. Passwords should always be encoded using a secure hashing 
 algorithm. There are many standard algorithms like SHA or MD5 which combined 
 with a proper SALT can be a good choice for password encoding. 
 Create Sample login Spring Security application which provides 
 BCryptPasswordEncoder, and implementation of Springâ€™s PasswordEncoder 
 interface that uses the BCrypt strong hashing function to encode the password
